# Bank_Loan_Analysis_Dashboard_PowerBI

# Problem Statement
To Develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for bank loan analysis, offering real-time insights into loan performance. The dashboard categorizes loans as good or bad, facilitating detailed evaluation of loan quality, and providing in-depth analysis of loan seeker demographics, enabling a better understanding of customer profiles and trends. <br />

## Project Overview:
* Total Loan Applications: 38.58K
* Total Funded Amount: $435.8M
* Total Amount Received: $473.1
* Average Interest Rate: 12%
* Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): 13.3%
* MoM increase in loan applications is 6.9%.
* MoM increase in loan amount is 13%.

This comprehensive analysis will provide actionable insights to help make data-driven decisions and evaluate the health of the loan portfolio.

## Dashboard 1: 
* **Summary & KPIs:** I developed a dynamic dashboard providing a snapshot of crucial metrics like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest
  Rate, and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI). These metrics, tracked MoM, shed light on the trends and shifts in our loan activities.

  Additionally, I dived into the analysis of Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs, breaking down the data to understand the quality and performance of our loan portfolio better.

## Dashboard 2: 
* **Visual Overview:** Leveraging Excel’s charting capabilities, I created visual representations such as: <br />
- Line Charts for Monthly Trends by Issue Date <br />
- Filled Maps for Regional Analysis <br />
- Donut Charts for Loan Term Analysis <br />
- Bar Charts for Employee Length and Loan Purpose Breakdown <br />
- Tree Maps for Home Ownership Analysis <br />

# Scope
• Average DTI is 13.3%, which is way below the good DTI score i.e. 35%, which means there is more loan potential in the market. <br />
• Bad loans account for 13.8% of total loans. The target can be to bring it down to below 10%. <br />
• Total lost amount due to bad loans is 32.2M. <br />
• 53.3% (232.46M) of the total loan amount is taken for debt consolidation. <br />
• States with a bad loan percentage higher than average i.e. 13.8% should try to reduce it to the average. <br />
